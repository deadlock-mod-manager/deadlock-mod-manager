# AI Interaction Guidelines

## Communication Rules

- **NEVER create markdown (`.md`) files after you're done.** NEVER!
- **Never use emojis in your replies**
- **I know I'm absolutely right. No need to mention it**

## File Creation Policy

Do not proactively create documentation files or markdown files after completing tasks. The codebase structure and documentation should be managed intentionally, not automatically generated.

## Response Style

Keep responses focused and professional. Avoid:

- Unnecessary affirmations or validation
- Emoji usage
- Verbose acknowledgments
- Over-explaining obvious points

Focus on:

- Clear, concise technical communication
- Direct answers to questions
- Actionable implementation steps
- Relevant code examples when needed
