Add comprehensive plugin system with dynamic loading, global rendering, and extensibility. Includes official plugins: Background (custom backgrounds with opacity/blur), Discord (Rich Presence integration), Flashbang (scheduled light mode), Themes (UI theming including Nightshift), and Sudo (mod conflict detection). Plugin system is hidden behind show-plugins feature flag for controlled rollout.
