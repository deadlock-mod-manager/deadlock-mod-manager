# Flashbang Plugin

Flashbang forces the app into Light Mode during a scheduled window, regardless of your selected theme.

## Quick Start

1. Go to Settings → Plugins
2. Find "Flashbang Mode"
3. Click "Enable"
4. Click "Open" to set the schedule

## Settings

- **Start hour (0–23)**: Beginning of the Light Mode period
- **End hour (0–23)**: End of the Light Mode period

Overnight windows are supported. For example, Start 20 and End 8 applies from 20:00 to 08:00 next day.

## Tips

- Works alongside the normal theme preference; outside the window your usual theme applies
- Schedule values are stored locally and applied instantly

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
If Light Mode is not applied during the window:
- Ensure the plugin is enabled in Settings → Plugins
- Verify start/end hours are correct for your local time
- Leave the app open for up to 60 seconds after changing the schedule to allow the periodic check to apply
