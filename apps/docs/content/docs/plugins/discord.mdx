# Discord Plugin

The Discord plugin displays your Deadlock Mod Manager activity on your Discord profile using Rich Presence.

## Quick Start

1. Go to Settings → Plugins
2. Find "Discord Rich Presence"
3. Click "Enable"
4. Click "Open" to customize

<Callout>
No setup required — this plugin uses our official Discord application. You can customize the text that appears on your profile.
</Callout>

## Customization

- **Details Text**: First line in your Rich Presence
- **State Text**: Second line under details
- **Show Elapsed Time**: Toggle whether a running timer is shown

### Examples

- Details: Managing Deadlock Mods
- State: Using Deadlock Mod Manager

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
If presence doesn't appear:
- Ensure Discord is running and you are logged in
- Keep the app in the foreground for a few seconds after enabling
- Toggle the plugin off and on again to reconnect
</Callout>

## Technical Notes

The plugin uses a shared Application ID and sets Rich Presence via a Tauri command. Only text fields are customizable; images are disabled to avoid per-user app setup.
