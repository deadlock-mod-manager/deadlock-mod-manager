4. **Launch the application** from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

## Post-Installation Setup

After installing Deadlock Mod Manager, you'll need to complete the initial setup:

### First Launch

1. **Launch the application** from your desktop or applications menu
2. **Grant necessary permissions** when prompted (file system access for mod installation)
3. The app will attempt to **automatically detect your Deadlock installation**

### Verify Installation

To ensure everything is working correctly:

![First Launch](/assets/verify.png)

1. **Check the bottom status bar** - API should be online (green) and the game should be "ready".
2. **Browse the Mods tab** - you should see available mods loading
3. **Test downloading a mod** - try installing a simple mod to verify functionality

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Common Issues

#### "App won't start" or crashes on launch

- **Windows**: Run as administrator once, then normally
- **Linux**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` on Ubuntu)

#### "Cannot find Deadlock installation"

- Verify Deadlock is installed through Steam
- Check that the game has been launched at least once
- If the game is still not detected, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/deadlock-mod-manager/deadlock-mod-manager/issues) with your system info and the steps you took to install the game.

#### Download/installation issues

- Check your internet connection
- Verify you have write permissions to the Deadlock directory
- Try running the app as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
