   ```

2. **Check Windows Defender/Antivirus**

   # Available from Microsoft's website
   ```

4. **Update Windows**
   - Ensure you're running Windows 10 version 1903 or later
   - Install all pending Windows updates

#### Linux Solutions

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev

   # Arch Linux

   WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 deadlock-modmanager
   ```

3. **Permissions Issues**

   # Make AppImage executable
   chmod +x deadlock-modmanager-*.AppImage
   ```

### Game Detection Problems

**Symptoms:** The mod manager can't find your Deadlock installation.

#### Automatic Detection Failed

1. **Verify Deadlock Installation**

   - Ensure Deadlock is installed through Steam
   - Launch Deadlock at least once to create necessary files
   - Verify the game runs without issues

2. **Check Steam Library Locations**

   - Open Steam Settings > Downloads > Steam Library Folders
   - Note all library locations where games might be installed
   - Look for Deadlock in each library under `steamapps/common/Deadlock`

## Download and Installation Issues

### Download Failures

**Symptoms:** Mods fail to download or downloads stop unexpectedly.

#### Network Issues

1. **Check Internet Connection**

   - Test your internet connection with other applications
   - Try downloading from a web browser to test connectivity

2. **Firewall/Antivirus Blocking**

   - Add Deadlock Mod Manager to firewall exceptions
   - Check if your antivirus is blocking downloads
   - Temporarily disable firewall/antivirus to test

3. **Proxy/VPN Issues**
   - If using a proxy or VPN, try disabling it temporarily
   - Configure proxy settings if needed in the app settings

#### Server Issues

1. **GameBanana Server Problems**

   - Check if GameBanana is accessible in your web browser
   - Wait and retry if servers are experiencing issues
   - Try downloading at a different time of day

2. **Regional Restrictions**
   - Some mods may have regional download restrictions
   - Try using a VPN to a different region if necessary

### Mod Installation Failures

**Symptoms:** Downloads complete but mods don't install properly.

#### Permission Issues

1. **Insufficient Permissions**

   ```bash
   # Windows: Run as administrator
   # Linux: Check folder permissions
   sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/deadlock/installation
   ```

2. **Read-only Files**

   - Check if game files are set to read-only
   - Disable Steam's file verification if enabled
   - Ensure no other applications have game files locked

3. **Access is denied. (os error 5)**
   - This error typically occurs when the mod manager lacks permission to modify files
   - **gameinfo.gi is read-only:** Right-click the file, select Properties, and uncheck "Read-only"
   - **Addons folder is read-only:** Check folder properties and remove read-only attribute
   - **High-privilege existing mods:** Some mods may have been installed with elevated privileges and cannot be removed by the mod manager. Try running the mod manager as administrator or manually remove the problematic mod files

#### Disk Space Issues

1. **Check Available Space**
   - Verify sufficient disk space in both download and game directories
   - Clear temporary files if space is low
   - Move game installation to a drive with more space if needed

### Stuck Downloads and Installations

**Symptoms:** Mods get stuck during download or installation process and won't complete.

#### Recovery Solutions

1. **Remove Individual Stuck Mod**

   - Use the trash can icon next to the stuck mod to remove it
   - Wait for the removal process to complete
   - Try downloading/installing the mod again

2. **Clear All Mods (Nuclear Option)**

   <Callout type="warn" title="Important: Backup First!">
     Before using Clear All Mods, **ALWAYS** take a screenshot of your installed
     mods list or backup your mods manually.
   </Callout>

   If individual mod removal doesn't work:

   - Navigate to **Settings > Tools**
   - Click the **"Clear All Mods"** button
   - This will remove all mod manager entries but preserve the actual mod files

3. **Alternative Manual Recovery**

   If you prefer more control over the process:

   - Copy all mods from your game's `addons` folder to a safe backup location
   - Use the **Clear All Mods** button in Settings > Tools
   - Copy the backed-up mods back to the `addons` folder
   - Use **Local Analyze Addons** feature to re-add them to the mod manager
   - This ensures you don't lose any mods while fixing stuck states

## Mod-Related Issues

### Mods Not Working In-Game

**Symptoms:** Mods appear installed but don't work in Deadlock.

#### Game Version Compatibility

1. **Check Game Version**

2. **Mod Updates Required**
   - Check if the mod has been updated for recent game versions

   - Check that mod files are in the correct game directories

   - Try reinstalling the problematic mod

2. **Mod Conflicts**
   - Disable other mods to test if there's a conflict
