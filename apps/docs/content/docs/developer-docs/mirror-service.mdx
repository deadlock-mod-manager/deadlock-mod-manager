# Mirror Service

The mirror service is a dedicated caching layer for mod file downloads that improves performance, reduces load on external APIs, and provides bandwidth savings through intelligent file caching.

## Service Overview

### Purpose

The mirror service acts as an intermediary between clients and the GameBanana API, caching frequently accessed mod files in S3 storage. This provides:

- **Faster Downloads**: Cached files are served directly from S3 with lower latency
- **Reduced API Load**: Minimizes requests to GameBanana API
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Tracks and reports bandwidth saved through caching
- **High Availability**: Files remain accessible even if upstream sources are temporarily unavailable

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (high-performance JavaScript runtime)
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight web framework)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage
- **Cache**: Redis (for metrics and metadata)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for file metadata tracking)
- **Background Jobs**: Cron-based workers for validation and cleanup

## Data Flow

### Cache Hit Flow

When a file already exists in the cache:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Mirror as Mirror Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant S3 as S3 Storage
    participant Redis
    participant Metrics as MetricsService

    Client->>Mirror: GET /download/:modId/:fileId
    Mirror->>DB: Check mirrored_files table
    DB-->>Mirror: File metadata found

    Mirror->>S3: Check file exists
    S3-->>Mirror: File exists

    Mirror->>Metrics: Increment cache hit
    Metrics->>Redis: INCR cache_hits

    Mirror->>DB: Update last_downloaded_at
    Mirror->>S3: Stream file
    S3-->>Mirror: File stream
    Mirror-->>Client: Stream response (200 OK)

    Note over Mirror,Client: File served from cache
```

### Cache Miss Flow

When a file needs to be downloaded and cached:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Mirror as Mirror Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant S3 as S3 Storage
    participant GB as GameBanana
    participant Redis
    participant Metrics as MetricsService

    Client->>Mirror: GET /download/:modId/:fileId
    Mirror->>DB: Check mirrored_files table
    DB-->>Mirror: File not found / stale

    Mirror->>Metrics: Increment cache miss
    Metrics->>Redis: INCR cache_misses

    Mirror->>DB: Get download URL
    DB-->>Mirror: GameBanana URL

    Mirror->>GB: Fetch file
    GB-->>Mirror: File stream

    par Stream to client and S3
        Mirror-->>Client: Stream response (200 OK)
    and
        Mirror->>S3: Upload stream
        S3-->>Mirror: Upload complete
        Mirror->>DB: Create mirrored_files entry
    end

    Note over Mirror,Client: File cached for future requests
```

### Validation Worker Flow

Background worker that validates cached files:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cron as Cron Service
    participant Worker as Validation Worker
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant S3 as S3 Storage

    Cron->>Worker: Trigger (every N hours)
    Worker->>DB: Get all mirrored_files with mod_downloads

    loop For each file
        Worker->>DB: Check if mod_download exists

        alt Mod download deleted
            Worker->>S3: Delete file
            Worker->>DB: Delete mirrored_file entry
        else File size mismatch
            Worker->>S3: Delete stale file
            Worker->>DB: Mark as stale
        else File valid
            Worker->>DB: Update last_validated timestamp
        end
    end

    Worker->>Cron: Job complete (metrics)
```

### Cleanup Worker Flow

Background worker that removes unused files:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cron as Cron Service
    participant Worker as Cleanup Worker
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant S3 as S3 Storage

    Cron->>Worker: Trigger (daily at 2 AM)
    Worker->>DB: Find files not downloaded in N days

    loop For each unused file
        Worker->>S3: Delete file
        Worker->>DB: Delete mirrored_file entry
    end

    Worker->>Cron: Job complete (files deleted, storage freed)
```

## Core Components

### MirrorService

The main service orchestrator that handles file mirroring logic.

**Responsibilities:**

- Check if file exists in cache and is not stale
- Stream cached files from S3
- Fetch files from GameBanana on cache miss
- Upload files to S3 while streaming to client
- Track cache hits and misses
- Create mirrored file metadata entries

**Key Methods:**

- `mirrorFile(modId: string, fileId: string)` - Main entry point for file downloads

```typescript
// Simplified flow
async mirrorFile(modId: string, fileId: string) {
  // Check cache
  const cached = await this.mirroredFileRepository.findByModIdAndFileId(modId, fileId);

  if (cached.isOk() && !cached.value.isStale) {
    // Verify S3 file exists
    if (await S3Service.instance.fileExists(cached.value.s3Key)) {
      // Cache hit - stream from S3
      await MetricsService.instance.incrementCacheHit();
      return S3Service.instance.downloadFileStream(cached.value.s3Key);
    }
  }

  // Cache miss - fetch from upstream
  await MetricsService.instance.incrementCacheMiss();
  const file = await fetch(gamebananaUrl);

  // Upload to S3 and stream to client simultaneously
  const { outputStream, uploadPromise } =
    S3Service.instance.uploadAndStreamThrough(key, file.body, onFileUploaded);

  return outputStream;
}
```

### S3Service

Handles all S3 storage operations using Bun's built-in S3Client.

**Responsibilities:**

- Upload files to S3
- Download files from S3
- Check file existence
- Delete files from S3
- Stream-through uploads (upload while streaming to client)

**Key Methods:**

- `uploadFileStream(key, stream)` - Upload a file stream
- `downloadFileStream(key)` - Download a file as a stream
- `uploadAndStreamThrough(key, stream, onSuccess)` - Upload and stream simultaneously
- `fileExists(key)` - Check if file exists in S3
- `deleteFile(key)` - Remove file from S3

**Stream-Through Pattern:**

The service uses stream tee-ing to upload to S3 and stream to the client simultaneously:

```typescript
uploadAndStreamThrough(key: string, sourceStream: ReadableStream, onSuccess: (hash: string) => void) {
  // Split stream into two
  const [streamForS3, streamForResponse] = sourceStream.tee();

  // Upload to S3 in background
  const uploadPromise = uploadToS3(streamForS3);

  // Return stream for immediate client response
  return {
    outputStream: streamForResponse,
    uploadPromise
  };
}
```

### MetricsService

Tracks cache performance and download statistics using Redis.

**Responsibilities:**

- Track cache hits and misses
- Track download counts per file
- Calculate cache hit rate
- Calculate bandwidth savings
- Provide top downloads statistics

**Key Methods:**

- `incrementCacheHit()` - Increment cache hit counter
- `incrementCacheMiss()` - Increment cache miss counter
- `incrementDownload(fileId)` - Track download for a specific file
- `getCacheHitRate()` - Calculate percentage of cache hits
- `calculateBandwidthSaved()` - Estimate bandwidth saved by caching
- `getTopDownloads(limit)` - Get most downloaded files
- `getMetrics()` - Get comprehensive metrics report

**Redis Keys:**

- `mirror:metrics:cache_hits` - Total cache hits
- `mirror:metrics:cache_misses` - Total cache misses
- `mirror:metrics:downloads:{fileId}` - Downloads per file

### ValidationProcessor

Background worker that validates cached files against upstream sources.

**Responsibilities:**

- Check if mod downloads still exist in database
- Validate file sizes match upstream
- Mark stale files for re-download
- Delete orphaned files
- Update validation timestamps

**Configuration:**

- Runs every N hours (configurable via `VALIDATION_WORKER_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
- Default: Every hour

**Process:**

1. Fetch all mirrored files with their mod download relationships
2. For each file:
   - Check if mod download still exists
   - Compare file sizes
   - Delete files if mod download deleted
   - Mark as stale if size mismatch
   - Update last_validated timestamp if valid

### CleanupProcessor

Background worker that removes unused files based on retention policy.

**Responsibilities:**

- Find files not downloaded within retention period
- Delete files from S3
- Remove database entries
- Track storage freed

**Configuration:**

- Runs daily at 2 AM
- Retention period: N days (configurable via `CLEANUP_RETENTION_DAYS`)
- Default: 14 days

**Process:**

1. Query files where `last_downloaded_at < NOW() - N days`
2. For each file:
   - Delete from S3
   - Delete from database
   - Track storage freed

## API Endpoints

### Download Endpoint

```
GET /download/:modId/:fileId
```

- `Content-Length: {size}`

**Example:**

```bash
curl https://mirror.deadlockmods.app/download/abc123/xyz789 -o mod.zip
```

### Health Check Endpoints

```
GET /
GET /health
```

Returns service health status.

**Response:**

  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Metrics Endpoint

```
GET /metrics
```

Returns comprehensive service metrics.

**Response:**

```json

  "cacheHitRate": 85.5,
  "totalStorageUsed": 1073741824,
  "totalFiles": 150,
  "bandwidthSaved": 5368709120,
  "topDownloads": [
    {
      "fileId": "file_123",
      "filename": "popular-mod.zip",
      "downloads": 500
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Integration with Main API

The mirror service is integrated with the main API service through a feature flag system.

### Feature Flag

The `mod-download-mirroring` feature flag controls whether the API returns mirror URLs or direct GameBanana URLs.

```typescript
// In API service
const isModDownloadMirroringEnabled =
  await featureFlagsService.isFeatureEnabled("mod-download-mirroring", userId);

const downloads = files.map((download) => ({
  ...download,
  url: isModDownloadMirroringEnabled.unwrapOr(false)
    ? `${env.MIRROR_SERVICE_URL}/download/${modId}/${download.id}`
    : download.url, // Direct GameBanana URL
}));
```

### URL Generation

When mirroring is enabled:

- **Format**: `https://mirror.deadlockmods.app/download/{modId}/{fileId}`
- **Example**: `https://mirror.deadlockmods.app/download/abc123/xyz789`

When mirroring is disabled:

- **Format**: Direct GameBanana URL
- **Example**: `https://files.gamebanana.com/mods/abc123.zip`

### Graceful Degradation

If the mirror service is unavailable:

1. Clients receive 404 or 500 errors from mirror service
2. Clients can fall back to direct GameBanana URLs
3. Feature flag can be disabled to bypass mirror service

### Database Schema

The mirror service uses the `mirrored_files` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mirrored_files (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  mod_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  mod_download_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  remote_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  s3_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  s3_bucket TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  mirrored_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_downloaded_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_validated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  is_stale BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  FOREIGN KEY (mod_download_id) REFERENCES mod_downloads(id)
);
```

**Key Fields:**

- `is_stale` - Marks files that need re-download (size mismatch)
- `last_downloaded_at` - Used for cleanup retention policy
- `last_validated` - Tracks validation worker progress
- `file_hash` - SHA-256 hash for integrity verification
